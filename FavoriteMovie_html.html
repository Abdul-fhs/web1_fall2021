        <h3>Recommendation</h3>
          <p>I am a fan of long season, good quality anime with great animation and story. Hunter x Hunter is a perfect mix of the two. Anime fans will tell you that the show might have ended, but no one has forgotten the experience to this day. I recommend to everyone to watch this anime who want good quality animation and good story in animes because it offers both.
